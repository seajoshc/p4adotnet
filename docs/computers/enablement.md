## Metrics

[Wisdom from Abi Noda](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abinoda_calculating-engineering-metrics-perfectly-activity-7125114089193816064-F5A3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Calculating engineering metrics perfectly is impossible. Take cycle time, for example:

- Calculating it from PR open to merge creates fuzziness based on when devs open PRs

- If you try to calculate from "first commit", Git rebases muddy your numbers

- Also: your metrics aren't factoring out non-working hours or weekends

- And some teams don't use PRs at all

It's fine to settle for "good enough".

All metrics are proxies.

It's the trends and comparisons that give you the most signal.
