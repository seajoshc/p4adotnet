Sugar - ½ cup granulated sugar.

Butter - ¼ cup of salted butter at room temperature.
Cooking Oil - ¼ cup cooking oil.
Eggs - 2 large eggs, beaten, and at room temperature.

Milk - 1 cup of milk or buttermilk, at room temperature.

MAKE THE DONUT BATTER
Prep. Preheat your oven to 425°F (218°C) and lightly grease your donut pans or mini-donut pans.
Make the batter. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add the room temperature ¼ cup softened butter, ¼ cup cooking oil, ½ cup sugar, and ⅓ cup light brown sugar. Cream together the wet ingredients, then add the 2 large beaten eggs, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 ½ teaspoons of vanilla extract, and ¾ salt. Mix until evenly distributed.
Add remaining ingredients. Add 2 ⅔ cups of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of milk into the wet ingredients, alternating and adding each in gradual amounts. You want the batter thoroughly combined, but do not over-mix once it comes together.

FILL DONUT PAN & BAKE
Fill the donut pans. Transfer the batter into your prepared donut pans, filling each donut cavity approximately ⅔ full.
Bake. Place the donut pans onto the center rack in your preheated oven and bake for 8-10 minutes until they have risen, and are golden on the bottom (you can see the lightly browned edges).
Cool. Remove the baked donuts from your oven and leave them in the pan for 5 minutes before flipping them out onto a wire cooling rack.
Add toppings. Add your desired sugar, cinnamon sugar, icing, and any other toppings once cooled.
