## Cake

### Ingredients

Dry:

- 2 cups flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

Wet:

- 1 cup of buttermilk
- 1/2 cup of vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup of boiling water or coffee

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease pan.
1. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
1. Mix buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Beat until well combined.
1. Combine wet + dry.
1. Slowly mix in hot water or coffee (batter will be thin, but that’s normal).
1. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
1. Let cake cool in pan completely before adding frosting.

## Frosting

### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 tbsp heavy cream or milk
- Pinch of salt

### Instructions

1. Use stand mixer with the paddle attachment (flat beater if available). The paddle gives the frosting a smooth, creamy texture without incorporating too much air, which is ideal for spreading on a sheet cake.
1. Beat the butter for 2 minutes until pale and fluffy.
1. Add powdered sugar, half cup at a time, mixing on low at first, then increasing speed.
1. Add vanilla and 3 tbsp of cream/milk. Mix on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes until fluffy.
1. Spread evenly over the completely cooled sheet cake.
