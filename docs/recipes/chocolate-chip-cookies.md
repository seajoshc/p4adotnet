# Chocolate chip cookies

Bakes 18 large cookies or 24 regular cookies

## Ingredients
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 2 sticks of unsalted butter (i.e. 1 cup) at room temp/softened
- 1 cup of dark brown sugar (light is okay)
- 1/2 cup white/granular sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 and 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips or chunks

## Recipe
I recommend a big 21in baking sheet and parchment paper.

1. Combine flour, salt, baking soda with a whisk in medium bowl.
1. Cream butter & sugar using a mixer until light and fluffy in a large bowl.
1. Mix the eggs one at a time into the butter & sugar. Then mix in the vanilla extract.
1. Mix the dry ingredients into the egg/butter/sugar mixture. Slowly add the flour mixture in, about 1/3 the bowl at a time as you combine.
1. Fold in the chocolate chips with a wooden spoon.
1. Chill the dough for at least 20min in the freezer, it will be too sticky to work with warm. Pre-heat the oven to 375F as the dough is chilling.
1. Fill your large baking sheet with 9 big hunks of dough and flatten them out slightly so its more of a disc and less of a ball. Bake them 11-12min. Or if you prefer regular sized cookies (i.e. 12 on a sheet), you will want to bake them closer to 10min. Keep an eye towards the end, ideally you want to pull them out when they are getting brown, and starting to firm, on the edges but slightly underdone in the middle still (this is the secret).
1. Leave them on the pan another 5 min, this will firm them up a bit more.
1. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool another 30 min at least. Patience here is key, they will be too soft to eat right away. But if you sneak a couple while they are still warm, I won't tell anyone.

They hold up well for several days if kept air tight.
