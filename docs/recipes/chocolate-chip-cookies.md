# Chocolate chip cookies

## Ingredients
- 2 cups plus 1 tbsp of flour (pastry or cake flour is best)
- 1 tsp salt
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 2 sticks of unsalted butter (i.e. 1 cup)
- 1 1/2 cup of (dark) brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips or chunks (add another 1/4 to 1/3 cup if you love chocolate)

## Recipe
1. Pre-heat to 375
1. Combine flour, salt, baking soda
1. Cream butter & sugar until light and fluffy
1. Add eggs one at a time, then vanilla extract
1. Fold in chocolate
1. Chill the dough (~10min in freezer or ~30min in fridge), it will be buttery and hard to work with warm
1. Grease the baking sheet (I use Pam)

1. Leave on pan another 5 min, transfer to wire rack to cool another 30 min
