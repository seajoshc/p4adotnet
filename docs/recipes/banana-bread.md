# Banana bread

See also [pumpkin bread](./pumpkin-bread.md)

## Ingredients
- 1 stick of softened butter (1/2 cup)
- 2 cups of all purpose flour, you can also swap 1/2 cup or 1 cup whole wheat flour for a heartier loaf
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 4 big bananas that are *very* ripe and mash easily
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 tsp nutmeg
- 3/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Recipe
1. Pre-heat oven to 375F
1. Grease a loaf pan with butter, I recommend [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JQEIC)
1. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a medium bowl
1. Cream the butter and sugars together in a large bowl until light and fluffy
1. Adds eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla, mixing on low speed
1. Add bananas and mix on low until just chunky bits remain
1. Stir the dry ingredients in until just combined, do not over mix it will be chunky
1. Gently fold in walnuts if you are using them
1. Pour into loaf pan (sprinkle some brown sugar on top!) and bake abut 60 minutes or until golden brown and tester comes out *almost* entirely clean
1. Cool in pan on a wire rack, or similar, for 15 minutes
1. Then turn pan upside gently and release the loaf on top of a cutting board
1. Flip it right side up, try to be patient it probably needs at least another 15min to cool/set in the middle

Serve warm or at room temperature, keep covered/sealed at room temperature. Add sprinkles or chocolate chips inside for a fun twist.

## Notes
- 4 large bananas works best after lots of experimentation :) But ultimately use what you have!
- 1/2 tsp of nutmeg + cinnamon if you want more banana flavor to come out, or even omit entirely if you want.
