# Fluffy Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake

## Ingredients:

- 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup milk
- 2 cups dark chocolate chips

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch rectangular sheet cake pan.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.

6. Fold in 1 1/2 cups of the dark chocolate chips, reserving the remaining 1/2 cup for topping.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared sheet cake pan, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on top.

8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.

9. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before serving.
