# Pizza

## Dough

Ingredients:

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp of oregano (optional)
- 1 tsp of garlic powder (optional)
- 1 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for coating)
- 1 tsp yeast (or you can use instant)
- 3/4 cup warm water (about 110°F)

Instructions:

1. Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes frothy.
2. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, oregano, and garlic powder (if using).
3. Combine: Once the yeast mixture is ready, add it along with the olive oil to the flour mixture.
4. Knead the Dough: On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. This step is crucial for developing the gluten, which gives the dough its texture.
5. Let it Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm area for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
6. Punch Down & Shape: Once risen, punch down the dough to release air bubbles. Divide it into portions if you want smaller pizzas, and shape it into your desired size.
7. Final Rise: Let the shaped dough rest for an additional 30 minutes.

Preheat Oven: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425°F to 475°F. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating.

Top & Bake: Add your favorite toppings and bake for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.

Tips:

- Cold Ferment for Flavor: For an even better flavor, let the dough cold ferment in the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours after the first rise.
- Hydration Matters: The water-to-flour ratio (hydration) can greatly affect the texture. This recipe is about 65% hydration, which is a good balance for most home ovens.
